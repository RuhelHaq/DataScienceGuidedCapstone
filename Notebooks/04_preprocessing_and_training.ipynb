    "In preceding notebooks, performed preliminary assessments of data quality and refined the question to be answered. You found a small number of data values that gave clear choices about whether to replace values or drop a whole row. You determined that predicting the adult weekend ticket price was your primary aim. You threw away records with missing price data, but not before making the most of the other available data to look for any patterns between the states. You didn't see any and decided to treat all states equally; the state label didn't seem to be particularly useful.\n",

    "In this notebook you'll start to build machine learning models. Before even starting with learning a machine learning model, however, start by considering how useful the mean value is as a predictor. This is more than just a pedagogical device. You never want to go to stakeholders with a machine learning model only to have the CEO point out that it performs worse than just guessing the average! Your first model is a baseline performance comparitor for any subsequent model. You then build up the process of efficiently and robustly creating and assessing models against it. The development we lay out may be little slower than in the real world, but this step of the capstone is definitely more than just instructional. It is good practice to build up an understanding that the machine learning pipelines you build work as expected. You can validate steps with your own functions for checking expected equivalence between, say, pandas and sklearn implementations."

    "So far, you've treated ski resort data as a single entity. In machine learning, when you train your model on all of your data, you end up with no data set aside to evaluate model performance. You could keep making more and more complex models that fit the data better and better and not realise you were overfitting to that one set of samples. By partitioning the data into training and testing splits, without letting a model (or missing-value imputation) learn anything about the test split, you have a somewhat independent assessment of how your model might perform in the future. An often overlooked subtlety here is that people all too frequently use the test set to assess model performance _and then compare multiple models to pick the best_. This means their overall model selection process is  fitting to one specific data set, now the test split. You could keep going, trying to get better and better performance on that one data set, but that's  where cross-validation becomes especially useful. While training models, a test split is very useful as a final check on expected future performance."

Here we see that our simple linear regression model explains over 80% of the variance on the train set and over 70% on the test set. Clearly you are onto something, although the much lower value for the test set suggests you're overfitting somewhat.

The whole point of keeping a test set is for it to be a set of that new data, to check how well our model might perform on data it hasn't seen.\n",
    "\n",
    "The way around this is a technique called _cross-validation_. You partition the training set into k folds, train our model on k-1 of those folds, and calculate performance on the fold not used in training. This procedure then cycles through k times with a different fold held back each time. Thus you end up building k models on k sets of data with k estimates of how the model performs on unseen data but without having to touch the test set."

    "These results suggest that vertical drop is your biggest positive feature. This makes intuitive sense and is consistent with what you saw during the EDA work. Also, you see the area covered by snow making equipment is a strong positive as well. People like guaranteed skiing! The skiable terrain area is negatively associated with ticket price! This seems odd. People will pay less for larger resorts? There could be all manner of reasons for this. It could be  an effect whereby larger resorts can host more visitors at any one time and so can charge less per ticket. As has been mentioned previously, the data are missing information about visitor numbers. Bear in mind,  the coefficient for skiable terrain is negative _for this model_. For example, if you kept the total number of chairs and fastQuads constant, but increased the skiable terrain extent, you might imagine the resort is worse off because the chairlift capacity is stretched thinner."

    "**Q: 1** Write a summary of the work in this notebook. Capture the fact that you gained a baseline idea of performance by simply taking the average price and how well that did. Then highlight that you built a linear model and the features that found. Comment on the estimate of its performance from cross-validation and whether its performance on the test split was consistent with this estimate. Also highlight that a random forest regressor was tried, what preprocessing steps were found to be best, and again what its estimated performance via cross-validation was and whether its performance on the test set was consistent with that. State which model you have decided to use going forwards and why. This summary should provide a quick overview for someone wanting to know quickly why the given model was chosen for the next part of the business problem to help guide important business decisions."

    "**Baseline Model (Mean Only):**\n",
    "To establish a benchmark, I first tested how well simply predicting the average adult weekend ticket price would perform. This baseline model  approach produced an R2 of zero on the training set, as expected, and slightly negative values on the test set, indicating it performed no better (and sometimes worse) than guessing the mean. The mean absolute error was about $19, providing a clear reference point: any  model must improve upon this basic level of performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Initial Linear Regression:** \n",
    "Next, we built a straightforward linear regression model using all available numeric features. Missing values were imputed with the median, and features were scaled to zero mean and unit variance to standardize them. This model showed significant improvement over the baseline, with an R2 of about 0.83 on the training data and around 0.71 on the test data, and an average error of about $9. The gap between training and test scores suggested some overfitting, indicating room for improvement by refining the feature set.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Refined Linear Regression with Feature Selection:**\n",
    "To reduce overfitting and improve generalizability, we refined the linear model by adding a feature selection step using SelectKBest. I used GridSearchCV to identify the optimal number of features, which turned out to be around eight. This reduced the complexity of the model while retaining the most predictive variables — including vertical drop, snow-making coverage, and lift capacity — all of which align with domain expectations. The cross-validated R2 averaged about 0.75 with low variability, and performance on the test split matched this estimate well, indicating a more robust model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Random Forest Regressor:**\n",
    "To capture possible non-linear patterns and interactions that a linear model might miss, we trained a Random Forest Regressor. After experimenting with preprocessing choices, we found that using median imputation worked best, while scaling did not significantly impact performance. I tuned the number of trees and evaluated different settings with GridSearchCV. This model achieved slightly better accuracy than the refined linear model, with a cross-validated mean absolute error about $1 lower and lower variability, suggesting more stable performance. The test set results were consistent with cross-validation, reinforcing confidence in the model’s reliability.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Final Model Decision:**\n",
    "Both the refined linear model and the Random Forest Regressor performed substantially better than the simple mean-based baseline. Between the two, the Random Forest Regressor demonstrated slightly higher predictive accuracy and greater robustness across different validation folds and on unseen data. For these reasons, we have chosen the Random Forest Regressor as the final model to carry forward. It provides a reliable foundation for future pricing strategies and business decisions."
